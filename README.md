# Pig Game

This is a project created by Jonas Schmedtmann for his course 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!' in the UDEMY platform.

# DEMO

In this game two players take turns rolling the dice to win points, the winner is the one who reaches 100 points first. If the number is different than 1 they can keep rolling and adding points, and can chose to hold the current points. Though if they roll a 1 they automatically lose their turn as well as their current points.
